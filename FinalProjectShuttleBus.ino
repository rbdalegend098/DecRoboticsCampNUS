/* (A) Automated Shuttle bus service robot:

Turn your robot into an automated shuttle bus service. (Think MRT/MTR/LRT but without the rail track).
It will stop at each "Station" designated for the selected "Bus" services you pick. & it will wait for the "Passengers" to descend or embark onto the shuttle bus.

Hint: You can utilize the color sensor & line sensor to signify a "Bus Station".

Use red light to signify a bus stop,
